For my scenario, I am collecting data for few Splunk usecases and below are the custom tables where data is stored :- 

Splunk_audit_CL	
Splunk_CL_audit_CL
Splunk_CL_Wind10_Alert_CL
Splunk_Error_CL
Splunk_Error_RTM_CL
Splunk_Win10_CL



//Queries for counting the alert generated in the Splunk environment 
search "Splunk_" | summarize  Total_Alerts_Splunk = count() by $table
//End of query




//Comparing one specific type of incidents. 
Splunk_Win10_CL | extend Title = Type
| join SecurityIncident on Title
| summarize count() by Title
//End of query
